```text
pxctl help
```

```
px cli

      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context

  -v, --version          print version and exit

Use "pxctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

{{<info>}}
As seen above, `pxctl` provides the capability to perform fine-grained control of the PX resources cluster-wide. Also, it lets the user manage volumes, snapshots, cluster resources, hosts in the cluster and software upgrade in the cluster.
{{</info>}}

In addition, every command takes in a `-j` which converts the output to machine parsable `JSON` format. You can do something like the following to save the the output in `JSON` format:

```text
pxctl status -j > status.json
```

In most production deployments, you will provision volumes directly using _Docker_ or your scheduler \(such as a _Kubernetes_ pod spec\). However, `pxctl` also lets you directly provision and manage storage. In addition, `pxctl` has a rich set of cluster-wide management features which are explained in this document.

All operations available through `pxctl` are reflected back into the containers that use Portworx storage. In addition to what is exposed in Docker volumes, `pxctl`:

*   Gives access to Portworx storage-specific features, such as cloning a running containerâ€™s storage.
*   Shows the connection between containers and their storage volumes.
*   Lets you control the Portworx storage cluster, such as adding nodes to the cluster. \(The Portworx tools refer to servers managed by Portworx storage as _nodes_.\)

The scope of the `pxctl` command is global to the cluster. Running `pxctl` on any node within the cluster, therefore, shows the same global details. But `pxctl` also identifies details specific to that node.

The current release of `pxctl` is located in the `/opt/pwx/bin/` directory of every **worker node** and requires that you run as it as a privileged user.

Let's look at some simple commands.

#### Version

Here's how to find out the current version:

```text
pxctl -v
```

```
pxctl version 2.1.0.0-d594892 (OCI)
```

#### Status

The status command gives a summary like node details, cluster members,  global storage capacity, etc.

The following example shows how the output looks like if the global capacity for the Docker containers is 128 GB.

```text
pxctl status
```

```

```

#### Upgrade related operations

`pxctl` provides access to several upgrade related operations. You can get details on how to use it and of the available flags by running:

```text
pxctl upgrade --help
```

```
Usage:
  pxctl upgrade [flags]

Flags:
  -l, --tag string   Specify a PX Docker image tag
  -h, --help         help for upgrade

Global Flags:
      --ca string        path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json             output in json
      --key string       path to client key for ssl usage
      --raw              raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx
```

##### Running pxctl upgrade

`pxctl upgrade` upgrades the PX version on a node. Let's suppose you want to upgrade PX to version _1.1.16_. If so, you would then type the following command:

```text
pxctl upgrade --tag 1.1.6 my-px-enterprise
```

```
Upgrading my-px-enterprise to version: portworx/px-enterprise:1.1.6
Downloading PX portworx/px-enterprise:1.1.6 layers...
<Output truncated>
```

It is recommended to upgrade the nodes in a **staggered manner**. This way, the quorum and the continuity of IOs will be maintained.

#### Login/Authentication

You must make PX login to the secrets endpoint when using encrypted volumes and ACLs.

`pxctl secrets` can be used to configure authentication credentials and endpoints.
Currently, Vault, Amazon KMS, and KVDB are supported.

##### Vault example

Here's an example of configuring PX with Vault:

```text
pxctl secrets vault login --vault-address http://myvault.myorg.com --vault-token myvaulttoken
```

```
Successfully authenticated with Vault.
```

{{<info>}}
**Note:**
To install and configure Vault, peruse [this link](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/index.html)
{{</info>}}

##### AWS KMS example

To configure PX with Amazon KMS, type the following command:

```text
pxctl secrets aws login
```

Then, you will be asked a few questions:

```
Enter AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID [Hit Enter to ignore]: ***
Enter AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY [Hit Enter to ignore]: ***
Enter AWS_SECRET_TOKEN_KEY [Hit Enter to ignore]: ***
Enter AWS_CMK [Hit Enter to ignore]: mykey
Enter AWS_REGION [Hit Enter to ignore]: us-east-1b
```

Finally, a success message will be displayed:

```
Successfully authenticated with AWS.
```
